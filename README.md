# OSECOR
Obelisk Web Security Core Assessment (OSECOR) is a web security posture scoring tool for security professionals, pentesters, and developers. It quantifies security (0-100%) based on key web factors. V1 is CLI-based for multi-layered assessments. A GUI version (v2) is planned for future release, offering both command-line and graphical options.
