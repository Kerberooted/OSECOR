# OSECOR - Obelisk Web Security Core Assessment

## Overview

The Obelisk Web Security Core Assessment (OSECOR) is an advanced web application security posture scoring tool designed for security professionals, penetration testers, and developers. By integrating some of the most powerful and widely used web security tools into a single streamlined assessment, OSECOR provides a quantifiable, graded security score (0-100%) based on key security factors. This helps users efficiently identify, measure, and improve the security of their web applications.

This release (v1) is a CLI-based tool that performs multi-layered security assessments that combine automated scanning techniques, leveraging industry standard tools such as OWASP ZAP, Nuclei, and Subfinder. A GUI version (v2) is planned for a future release, allowing users to choose between command-line and graphical interfaces for convenience.



## Features

Security Headers Analysis

Detects missing HTTP security headers such as CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and more.

Assigns negative points for missing or misconfigured headers.

SSL/TLS Security Assessment

Uses SSL Labs API to evaluate SSL/TLS configurations.

Identifies weak ciphers, outdated TLS versions, and assigns an overall security grade.

Active Vulnerability Scanning

Integrates OWASP ZAP and Nuclei to scan for XSS, SQLi, LFI, RCE, and other vulnerabilities.

Parses results and assigns scores based on CVSS scoring.

Authentication & Session Security Checks

Examines session security controls, secure cookies, HTTP-only flags, and MFA presence.

CMS & Technology Stack Enumeration

Detects outdated WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal versions.

Identifies potential misconfigurations and assigns risk scores.

Subdomain & Exposure Analysis

Uses Subfinder to identify exposed subdomains.

Checks for open directories, admin panels, and exposed assets.

Final Security Score Calculation

Uses a deterministic scoring algorithm to provide a clear, quantifiable security rating.

Generates structured JSON reports for further analysis.



## Use Cases

OSECOR is designed to support:

Penetration Testers & Bug Hunters – Automate reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment.

Security Engineers – Measure and track web security posture over time.

Developers – Identify missing security best practices before deployment.

IT & DevSecOps Teams – Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security testing.
